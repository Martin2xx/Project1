# Description
The website I created is for my fiance Ashley who is a hairstylist. Concept is to help clients request appointments and get information. Clients are able to view recent work.


# User Stories :
1. As a customer  I want to request an appointment so I can change my hairstyle.
2. As a new customer I want to see starting prices so I have an idea of how much I will spend.
3. As a current customer I want to share your website so my friend can get matching hair color.
